# Iraqi dolma

Iraqi dolma is famous throughout the middle east as one of the most delicious types of dolma you'll eat. Vegetables, stuffed with seasoned rice and vegetables and cooked in a tomato broth. There are so many versions of dolma just within Iraq (let alone outside of Iraq), and I love them all. But I'm going to share the one near and dear to my heart; my mom's dolma.
