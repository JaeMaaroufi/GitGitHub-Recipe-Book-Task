## Ingredients:
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 cup pizza sauce
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- Toppings of your choice (e.g., sliced pepperoni, diced bell peppers, sliced onions, sliced mushrooms)

## Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. In a separate small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes foamy.
2. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until the dough starts to come together.
3. Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a little more flour.
4. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a clean kitchen towel. Allow it to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until it doubles in size.
5. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven to heat up.
6. Punch down the dough to release any air bubbles. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into your desired pizza shape and thickness.
7. Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough onto a piece of parchment paper.
8. Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese on top.
9. Add your favorite toppings, such as sliced pepperoni, diced bell peppers, sliced onions, or sliced mushrooms.
10. Using a pizza peel or a flat baking sheet, carefully transfer the pizza (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven.
11. Bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
12. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
